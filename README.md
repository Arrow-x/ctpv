# ctpv

Terminal previewer

![showcase](doc/showcase.gif)

----

ctpv is an utility for previewing various files.

Image previews powered by:

* [Ãœberzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug)
* [Kitty terminal](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
* [Chafa](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa)

ctpv is a remake of an awesome program named
[stpv](https://github.com/Naheel-Azawy/stpv) written in C.
stpv worked perfectly for me, except it was kinda sluggish because
it was written in POSIX shell.
ctpv is an attempt to make a faster version of stpv and add some
new features.

Originally it was made for [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)
file manager but I believe that it can be easily integrated into
other programs as well if they support previews provided by
external programs like lf does.

## Dependencies

### Libraries

* `libcrypto`
* `libmagic`

### Previews

Previewing each file type requires specific programs.
If a program is not found on the system, ctpv
will try to use another one.
Only one program is required for each file type.
For example, you only need either `elinks`, `lynx` or
`w3m` installed on your system to view HTML files.

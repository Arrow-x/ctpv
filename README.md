# ctpv

File previewer for a terminal

![showcase](doc/showcase.gif)

----

ctpv is a file previewer utility for terminals.

It supports previews for source code, archives, PDF files, images
and videos (see [Previews](#previews)).

Image previews are powered by one of these:

* [Ãœberzug][ueberzug] (X11 only)
* [Kitty terminal][kitty]
* [Chafa][chafa]

ctpv is a remake of an awesome program named
[stpv](https://github.com/Naheel-Azawy/stpv)
written in C.
stpv worked perfectly for me, except it was kinda sluggish because
it was written in POSIX shell.
ctpv is an attempt to make a faster version of stpv and add some
new features.

Originally it was made for [lf]
file manager but I believe that it can be easily integrated into
other programs as well
(either via configuration file like in lf or a simple wrapper
script).

## Dependencies

### Libraries

* `libcrypto`
* `libmagic`

### Previews

Previewing each file type requires specific programs.
If a program is not found on the system, ctpv
will try to use another one.
Only one program is required for each file type.
For example, you only need either `elinks`, `lynx` or
`w3m` installed on your system to view HTML files.

## Integration

### lf file manager

Add these lines to your lf config

#### Wayland

If you use Wayland, follow these steps:

* Install [this fork of lf][lf-sixel]
* Install [Chafa][chafa]

As of 2023-03-19, original lf does not support sixel protocol,
which is why you need use the fork.

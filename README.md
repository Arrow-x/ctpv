# ctpv

Terminal previewer

![showcase](doc/showcase.gif)

----

ctpv is an utility for previewing various files
(including images with [Ãœberzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug)).

ctpv is a remake of an awesome program named
[stpv](https://github.com/Naheel-Azawy/stpv) written in C.
stpv worked perfectly for me, except it was kinda sluggish because
it was written in POSIX shell.
ctpv is an attempt to make a faster version of stpv and add some
new features.

Originally it was made for [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)
file manager but I believe that it can be easily integrated into
other programs as well if they support previews provided by
external programs like lf does.

## Dependencies

These programs are needed to make specific previews work.
If a preview requires some program and it's not found on the system,
`ctpv` will fallback to other previews.

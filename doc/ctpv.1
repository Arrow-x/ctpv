.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B ctpv
is a previewer utility made for integration into other programs.
It supports a variety of \(lqpreviews\(rq out of the box
(including one for previewing images with
.IR ueberzug )
and an option for defining custom previews.
.
.SS Integration
.
The following snippets should be added to configuration files
of corresponding programs:
.
.TP
\fIlf\fP file manager:
.EX
set previewer ctpv
set cleaner ctpvclear
&ctpv -s $id
cmd on-quit $ctpv -e $id
.EE
.
.SS How previews are selected
.
Initially,
.B ctpv
retrieves MIME type and extension from
.I file
given in the first argument (MIME type is extracted using
.BR magic (5)).
.PP
.
Then it creates a list of all previews in a special order,
where previews that are more specific appear at the top
and more generic ones at the bottom.
The list can be viewed by using
.B \-l
option. The order can be changed, see
.IR "Setting priority" .
.PP
.
Finally,
.B ctpv
goes through the list starting with the first element
and checks if a preview matches
.IR file \(aqs
extension and MIME type.
If it does, it runs the preview script.
If the script exits with status 127
(which usually means that a command was not found),
the next appropriate preview is selected, and so on.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B \-l
List all previews.
.
.TP
.Bsi \-m files \*(op
Print extension and MIME type of specified files.
.
.TP
.Bsi \-s id
Start server with ID
.IR id .
.
.TP
.Bsi \-c id
Send
.B clear
command to server with ID
.I id
(usually, it removes image from terminal).
.
.TP
.Bsi \-e id
Kill server with ID
.IR id .
.
.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.
The configuration file format somewhat resembles one used by
.IR lf .
There are several commands that allow you to customize
.B ctpv
behavior.
Commands are separated by newlines.
Comments start with number sign
.RB ( # )
like in many other formats.
.
.SS Defining custom previews
.
A snippet below defines a new preview with name
.I cow
that applies to files with extension
.IR .moo .
A preview itself is a shell script enclosed within double curly
braces (this particular one utilizes the famous
.I cowsay
program):
.
.Ex
preview cow .moo {{
	cowsay < "$f"
}}
.Ee
.
Running
.I "ctpv\ file.moo"
where
.I file.moo
contains \(lqsome text\(rq will produce the following output:
.
.Ex
\#  ___________ 
\# < some text >
\#  ----------- 
\#         \   ^__^
\#          \  (oo)\_______
\#             (__)\       )\/\
\#                 ||----w |
\#                 ||     ||
\& \(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul 
\&< some text >
\& \(mi\(mi\(mi\(mi\(mi\(mi\(mi\(mi\(mi\(mi\(mi 
\&        \(rs   ^\(ul\(ul^
\&         \(rs  (oo)\(rs\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul\(ul
\&            (\(ul\(ul)\(rs       )\(rs/\(rs
\&                ||\(mi\(mi\(mi\(miw |
\&                ||     ||
.Ee
.
Variable
.B $f
stores
.IR file
that was passed as a first argument to
.BR ctpv .
It's strongly suggested to enclose
.B $f
with double quotes
.RB ( \(dq$f\(dq )
because otherwise the script will not work as
expected if
.B $f
stores a filename with whitespace.
.PP
.
There are other variables that are exported into preview
script environment:
.BR $w ,
.BR $h ,
.BR $x ,
.BR $y
and
.BR $id .
However, they are rarely used even by built-in previews and
are only set if corresponding arguments were passed to
.B ctpv
command (see
.IR SYNOPSIS ).
.PP
.
You can specify MIME type instead of filename extension
in preview definition:
.
.Ex
preview json_example application/json {{
	# preview json files
}}
.Ee
.
And you also can omit subtype part of the MIME type
by replacing it with
.BR * .
.
.Ex
preview any_text_example text/* {{
	# this one applies to all text files
}}
.Ee
.
Setting subtype to
.B *
will make the preview work for any file which MIME type starts with
.BR text/ .
.
.SS Setting priority
If there are several previews that apply to the same file type,
only the top one in the list is chosen (see
.IR "How previews are selected" ).
To alter this behavior, you can use
.B priority
command to change preview priority:
.
.Ex
priority cat
.Ee
.
The snippet above sets priority of preview named \(lqcat\(rq to 1,
thus now it's used for all text files.
It's possible to specify an integer as the second argument
to set priority other than 1 (may also be negative).
.
.SS Removing previews
.
.B remove
command simply removes a preview (also works for built-in ones):
.
.Ex
remove cat
.Ee
.
.
.SH FILES
.
.TP
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ctpv/config
Configuration file. If
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
is empty or not set, defaults to
.IR $HOME/.config .
